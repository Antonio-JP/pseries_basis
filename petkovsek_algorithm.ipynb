    "\n",
    "In Proposition 1, Petkovsek provides an equivalent condition, in the case of *polynomial factorial basis*, for an operator $L$ to be $(A,B)$-compatible. Namely, $L$ is $(A,B)$ compatible if and only if:\n",
    "* **C.1.** For all $n \\geq 0$, $\\deg(L\\cdot P_n) \\leq n + B$.\n",
    "* **C.2.** For all $n \\geq A$, $P_{n-A} | L\\cdot P_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposition will be heavily used to proved compatibility for some operators in the _product basis_ defined below. Hence, a constructive proved is heavily desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Defining the goals for equivalence\n",
    "\n",
    "A first step to make the result constructive is define exactly what we need to compute. For the compatibility condition is pretty clear: we need to compute the values $A$, $B$ and $\\alpha_{n,i}$ for arbitrary (symbolic) $n$ and $-A \\leq i \\leq B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what exactly do we need to compute for the conditions **C.1** and **C.2**? For *C.1* we only need to compute the value of $B$. Then, for *C.2* we need to compute first the value of $A$. At this point, as $\\basis$ is a **polynomial factorial basis**, we have that for any $n$:\n",
    "$$\\frac{L(P_n)}{P_{n-A}} = c_{n,0} + \\dots c_{n,A+B}x^{A+B}.$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Increasing basis\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tool for performing this computation is what we will call the _increasing basis_. Using the fact that we are working with *polynomial factorial basis*, we have that for any $m > n$, $\\deg(P_m/P_n) = m-n$. \n",
    "* We define the $k$*-increasing basis* for $\\basis$ as $\\ibasis_k(\\basis) = \\left\\{I_{k,n}\\right\\}_{n\\geq 0}$ where\n",
    "  $$I_{k,n} = \\frac{P_{k+n}}{P_k}.$$\n",
    "* $\\ibasis_k$ **is a polynomial factorial basis for any** $k \\in \\nn$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  It is clear, as we have already mention, that $\\deg(I_{k,n}) = n$. And, as $\\basis$ is factorial, we also have that:\n",
    "  $$\\frac{I_{k,n+1}}{I_{k,n}} = \\frac{P_{k+n+1}P_k}{P_{k+n}P_k} = \\frac{P_{k+n+1}}{P_{k+n}} = a_{n+k+1}x + b_{n+k+1},$$\n",
    "  finishing the proof. $\\square$\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 3.3 Looking to the equivalence\n",

    "The compatibility condition provides the following identity:\n",
    "$$L(P_n) = \\sum_{i=-A}^B \\alpha_{n,i} P_{n+i},$$\n",

    "\n",
    "This means that the computation from the $c_{n,i}$ to the $\\alpha_{n,i}$ *is only a change of coordinates* between the usual power basis and the $(n-A)$-increasing basis for $\\basis$.\n",

    "### What is it implemented?\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `FactorialBasis` provides several methods to compute the equivalence of Proposition 1.

    "and each of those elements can be computed explicitly since each of the basis are factorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we can also compute the corresponding *increasing basis* from a fixed $n = km+j$. Hence we can apply the methodology in Section 3 to get the coefficients $\\alpha_{k,j,i}$. Repeating this for $j = 1,\\dots, m$ we are in a position to apply the method `get_compatibility_sections`.\n",
