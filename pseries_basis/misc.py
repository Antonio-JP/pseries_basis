def DefiniteSumSolutions(operator, *input):
    r'''
        Petkov≈°ek's algorithm for transforming operators into recurrence equations.
        
        This method is the complete execution for the algorithm **DefiniteSumSolutions** described in
        :arxiv:`1804.02964v1`. This methods takes an operator `L` and convert the problem
        of being solution `L \cdot y(x) = 0` to a recurrence equation assuming some hypergeometric
        terms in the expansion.
        
        The operator must be a difference operator of `\mathbb{Q}[x]<E>` where `E: x \mapsto x+1`. The operator may 
        belong to a different ring from the package *ore_algebra*, but the generator must have the 
        behavior previously described.
        
        This function does not check the nature of the generator, so using this algorithm with different 
        types of operators may lead to some inconsistent results.
        
        INPUT:

        * ``operator``: difference operator to be transformed.
        * ``input``: the coefficients of the binomial coefficients we assume appear in the expansion
          of the solutions. This input can be given with the following formats:
            - ``a_1,a_2,...,a_m,b_1,b_2,...,b_m``: an unrolled list of `2m` elements.
            - ``[a_1,a_2,...,a_m,b_1,b_2,...,b_m]``: a compress list of `2m` elements.
            - ``[a_1,...,a_m],[b_1,...,b_m]``: two lists of `m` elements.

        OUTPUT:

        An operator `\tilde{L}` such that if a sequence `(c_n)_n` satisfies `L \cdot (c_n)_n = 0` then 
        the power series

        .. MATH::

            y(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0}\prod{i=1}^m c_n\binom{a_i*x+b_i}{n}

        satisfies `L \cdot y(x) = 0`.

        Method to get a basis which includes the general binomial coefficients.

        This method creates a factorial basis as a :class:`ProductBasis` that contains the specified binomial coefficients
        in the corresponding positions of the sequence. The intermediate steps are a possible extension to obtain

        This method includes that compatibility in the basis after computing it with a guessing procedure (see 
        :func:`guess_compatibility_E` for further information). Then we also include the compatibility with the classical
        shift `E: x\mapsto x+1` using the compatibility with `\tilde{E}`.
