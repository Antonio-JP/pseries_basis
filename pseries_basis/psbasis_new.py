    Sage package for Power Series Basis.

    This module introduces the basic structures in Sage for computing with *Power
    Series Basis*. We based this work in the paper :arxiv:`2202.05550`
    by M. PetkovÅ¡ek, where all definitions and proofs for the algorithms here can be found.

    A Power Series basis is defined as a sequence `\{f_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \subset \mathbb{K}[[x]]`
    that form a `\mathbb{K}`-basis of the whole ring of formal power series. We distinguish
    between two basic type of basis:

    * Polynomial basis: here `f_n \in \mathbb{K}[x]` with degree equal to `n`.
    * Order basis: here `ord(f_n) = n`, meaning that `f_n = x^n g_n(x)` such that `g(0) \neq 0`.

    Any formal power series `g(x)` can be expressed in terms of the power series basis:

    .. MATH::

        g(x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \alpha_n f_n.

    The main aim of this work is to understand which `\mathbb{K}`-linear operators over the
    ring of formal power series are *compatible* with a power series basis, meaning that, 
    `L\cdot g(x) = 0` if and only if the sequence `\alpha_n` is P-recursive.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: from pseries_basis import *

    This package includes no example since all the structures it offers are abstract, so they should
    never be instantiated. For particular examples and test, look to the modules :mod:`~pseries_basis.factorial.factorial_basis`
    and :mod:`~pseries_basis.factorial.product_basis`.
