class SievedBasis(FactorialBasis):
    r'''
        Class for a Sieved Basis.

        A sieved basis is a factorial basis built from a finite set
        of source basis `B_i = \left(P_n^{(i)}(x)\right)_n` for `i=0,\ldots,F-1`. This is built 
        in `m` sections using a *deciding cycle*:

        .. MATH::

            (\sigma_0,\ldots,\sigma_{m-1})

        where `\sigma_i \in \{0,\ldots,F-1\}`. We can then define the `n`-th element
        of the basis with the following formula:

        .. MATH::

            Q_n(x) = \prod_{i=0}^F P_{e_i(n)}^{(i)}(x)

        where the following formula stands:
        
        * `n = km+r`, 
        * `S_i = \# \{ j \in \{0,\ldots,m-1\}\ :\ \sigma_j = i\}`,
        * `e_i(n) = S_im + \#\{j \in \{0,\ldots,r\}\ :\ \sigma_j = i\}`.

        If we look recursively, we can see that each element is built from the previous
        element by increasing one of the factors one degree in the corresponding basis:

        .. MATH::

            Q_n(x) = Q_{n-1}(x)\frac{P_{e_{\sigma_i}(n)}^{(\sigma_i)}(x)}{P_{e_{\sigma_i}(n)-1}^{(\sigma_i)}(x)}

        INPUT:

        * ``factors``: the basis that build the sieved basis.
        * ``cycle``: a tuple of length `m` indicating which factor use in each step.
        * ``init``: value for the constant element of the basis.
        * ``X``: name of the operator representing the multiplication by `x`.
        * ``ends``: endomorphism which compatibility we will try to extend.
        * ``ders``: derivations which compatibility we wil try to extend.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: from pseries_basis import *
            sage: B = BinomialBasis(); P = PowerBasis()
            sage: B2 = SievedBasis([B,P], [0,1,1,0])
            sage: B2[:6]
            [1, x, x^2, x^3, 1/2*x^4 - 1/2*x^3, 1/6*x^5 - 1/2*x^4 + 1/3*x^3]

        With this system, we can build the same basis changing the order and the values in the cycle::

            sage: B3 = SievedBasis([P,B], [1,0,0,1])
            sage: all(B3[i] == B2[i] for i in range(30))
            True

        The length of the cycle is the number of associated sections::

            sage: B2.nsections()
            4
            sage: SievedBasis([B,B,P],[0,0,1,2,1,2]).nsections()
            6

        This basis can be use to deduce some nice recurrences for the Apery's `\zeta(2)` sequence::

            sage: b1 = FallingBasis(1,0,1); b2 = FallingBasis(1,1,-1); n = b1.n()
            sage: B = SievedBasis([b1,b2],[0,1]).scalar(1/factorial(n))

        This basis ``B`` contains the elements 

        .. MATH::

            \begin{matrix}
            \binom{x + n}{2n}\ \text{if }n\equiv 0\ (mod\ 2)\\
            \binom{x + n}{2n+1}\ \text{if }n\equiv 1\ (mod\ 2)
            \end{matrix}

        We first extend the compatibility with `E: x\mapsto x+1` by guessing and then we compute the sieved basis
        with the binomial basis with the cycle `(1,0,1)`::

            sage: B.set_compatibility('E', guess_compatibility_E(B, sections=2))
            sage: B2 = SievedBasis([BinomialBasis(), B], [1,0,1], ends=['E'])

        Now the basis ``B2`` is formed in 3 sections by the following elements:

        .. MATH::

            \begin{matrix}
                \binom{x}{n}\binom{x+n}{2n}\ \text{if }n\equiv 0\ (mod\ 3)\\
                \binom{x}{n}\binom{x+n}{2n+1}\ \text{if }n\equiv 1\ (mod\ 3)\\
                \binom{x}{n+1}\binom{x+n}{2n+1}\ \text{if }n\equiv 2\ (mod\ 3)
            \end{matrix}

        We can check that `B2` is compatible with the multiplication by `x` and with 
        the endomorphism `E`::

            sage: a,b,m,alpha = B2.compatibility('x')
            sage: Matrix([[alpha(i,j,B2.n()) for j in range(-a,b+1)] for i in range(m)])
            [      n 2*n + 1]
            [      n   n + 1]
            [ -n - 1 2*n + 2]
            sage: B2.recurrence('x')
            [        n         0 (2*n)*Sni]
            [(2*n + 1)         n         0]
            [        0   (n + 1)  (-n - 1)]
            sage: a,b,m,alpha = B2.compatibility('E')
            sage: Matrix([[alpha(i,j,B2.n()) for j in range(-a,b+1)] for i in range(m)])
            [                      1           (4*n - 3/2)/n                     3/2                       1]
            [    (n - 1/2)/(n + 1/2)         1/2*n/(n + 1/2) (3/2*n + 1/2)/(n + 1/2)                       1]
            [                      0                       1       (3*n + 2)/(n + 1)                       1]
            sage: B2.recurrence('E')                                                                                                                                                         
            [                    Sn + 1        (3*n + 1)/(2*n + 1)                          1]
            [    (8*n + 5)/(2*n + 2)*Sn (2*n + 1)/(2*n + 3)*Sn + 1          (3*n + 2)/(n + 1)]
            [                    3/2*Sn       (n + 1)/(2*n + 3)*Sn                          1]

        Now consider the following difference operator:

        .. MATH::

            L = (x+2)^2 E^2 - (11x^2+33x+25)E - (x+1)^3

        This operator `L` is comp√†tible with the basis ``B2``. We can get then
        the associated recurrence matrix. Taking the first column and the GCRD
        of its elements, we can see that if a formal power series `y(x) = \sum_n y_n x^n`
        that can be written in the form `y(x) = \sum_{n\geq 0}c_n\binom{x}{n}\binom{x+n}{2n}` satisfies
        that

        .. MATH::

            (n+1)^2c_{n+1} - 2(2n+1)c_n = 0.

        Doing that with the code::

            sage: from ore_algebra import OreAlgebra
            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]; OE.<E> = OreAlgebra(R, ('E', lambda p : p(x=x+1), lambda p : 0))   
            sage: L = (x+2)^2*E^2 - (11*x^2 + 33*x+25)*E - (x+1)^2 
            sage: M = B2.recurrence(L)
            sage: column = [B2.remove_Sni(M.coefficient((j,0))) for j in range(M.nrows())]
            sage: column[0].gcrd(*column[1:])

            This method *overrides* the implementation from class :class:`FactorialBasis`. See :func:`FactorialBasis.compatible_division`
            for a description on the output.

            For a :class:`SievedBasis`, since its elements are products of elements of other basis, we can compute this 
            division using the information in the factors of ``self``. However, we need to know how this operator
            acts on products distinguishing between three classes:

            * **Multiplication operators**: `L(f(x)) = g(x)f(x)`.
            * **Endomorphisms**: `L(f(x)g(x)) = L(f(x))L(g(x))`.
            * **Derivations**: `L(f(x)g(x)) = L(f(x))g(x) + f(x)L(g(x))`.

            sage: B1 = BinomialBasis(); B2 = PowerBasis(); B3 = FallingBasis(1,0,1)
            sage: ProductBasis([B1,B2]).factors == (B1, B2)

            sage: ProductBasis([B1,B3,B2]).factors == (B1,B3,B2)
            True
            sage: ProductBasis([B1,B3,B2]).nfactors()
            3

        This class can be use to simplify the notation os :class:`SievedBasis`. The following example
        illustrates how this can be used to understand better the recurrence for the Apery's `\zeta(3)`-recurrence::

            sage: b1 = FallingBasis(1,0,1); b2 = FallingBasis(1,1,-1); n = b1.n()
            sage: B = ProductBasis([b1,b2]).scalar(1/factorial(n))

        This basis ``B`` contains the elements 

        .. MATH::

            \begin{matrix}
            \binom{x + n}{2n}\ \text{if }n\equiv 0\ (mod\ 2)\\
            \binom{x + n}{2n+1}\ \text{if }n\equiv 1\ (mod\ 2)
            \end{matrix}

        We first extend the compatibility with `E: x\mapsto x+1` by guessing and then we compute the product basis
        with itself::

            sage: B.set_compatibility('E', guess_compatibility_E(B, sections=2))
            sage: B2 = ProductBasis([B,B], ends=['E'])

        Now the basis ``B2`` is formed in 4 sections by the following elements:

        .. MATH::

            \begin{matrix}
                \binom{x+n}{2n}^2\ \text{if }n\equiv 0\ (mod\ 4)\\
                \binom{x+n}{2n}\binom{x+n}{2n+1}\ \text{if }n\equiv 1\ (mod\ 4)\\
                \binom{x+n}{2n+1}^2\ \text{if }n\equiv 2\ (mod\ 4)\\
                \binom{x+n+1}{2n+2}\binom{x+n}{2n+1}\ \text{if }n\equiv 3\ (mod\ 4)
            \end{matrix}

        We can check that ``B2`` is compatible with the multiplication by `x` and with 
        the endomorphism `E`::

            sage: a,b,m,alpha = B2.compatibility('x')
            sage: Matrix([[alpha(i,j,B2.n()) for j in range(-a,b+1)] for i in range(m)])
            [      n 2*n + 1]
            [      n 2*n + 1]
            [ -n - 1 2*n + 2]
            [ -n - 1 2*n + 2]
            sage: B2.recurrence('x')
            [        n         0         0 (2*n)*Sni]
            [(2*n + 1)         n         0         0]
            [        0 (2*n + 1)  (-n - 1)         0]
            [        0         0 (2*n + 2)  (-n - 1)]

        Now consider the following difference operator:

        .. MATH::

            L = (x+2)^3 E^2 - (2*x + 3)(17x^2+51x+39)E + (x+1)^3

        This operator `L` is comp√†tible with the basis ``B2``. We can get then
        the associated recurrence matrix. Taking the first column and the GCRD
        of its elements, we can see that if a formal power series `y(x) = \sum_n y_n x^n`
        that can be written in the form `y(x) = \sum_{n\geq 0}c_n\binom{x+n}{2n}^2` satisfies
        that

        .. MATH::

            Method to get the structure for the `n`-th increasing basis.

            This method *overrides* the corresponding method from :class:`SievedBasis`.
            See method :func:`~SievedBasis.increasing_basis` for further information.

            For a :class:`ProductBasis`, the increasing basis is again a :class:`ProductBasis` of the increasing basis
            of its factors. Depending on the actual shift, the increasing basis may differ. Namely, if the shift is 
            `N = kF+j` where `F` is the number of factors of ``self`` and `B_i` are those factors, then the `N`-th 
            increasing basis is the product:

            .. MATH::

                I(B_{j}, k)\cdots I(B_{F-1},k) I(B_0, k+1) \cdots I(B_{j-1}, k+1),

            where `I(\cdot, k)` is the `k`-th increasing basis of `\cdot`.
