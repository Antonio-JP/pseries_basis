Inverse Zeibelger Problem
=============================

This is the documentation for the package ``psbasis``.

The main package of this project is the package , you need to import it:: 

    from psbasis import *

This package allows the user to create and manipulate basis for a
power series ring, and provides methods to compute recurrence equations
for solutions of difference/differential equations within the ring
of formal power series.

This package synergies pretty naturally with other packages from the author 
and with the package ``ore_algebra`` from M. Kauers et. al.
