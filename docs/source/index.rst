Inverse Zeibelger Problem
=============================

This is the documentation for the package `psbasis`.

To use this module, you need to import it:: 

    from psbasis import *

This package allows the user to create and manipulate basis for a
power series ring, and provides methods to compute recurrence equations
for solutions of difference/differential equations within the ring
of formal power series.

This package sinergizes pretty naturally with other packages from the author 
and with the package `ore_algebra` from M. Kauers et. al.
